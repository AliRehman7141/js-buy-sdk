# How to contribute
We ❤️ pull requests. If you'd like to fix a bug, contribute a feature or
just correct a typo, please feel free to do so, as long as you follow
our Code of Conduct (below).

If you're thinking of adding a big new feature, consider opening an
issue first to discuss it to ensure it aligns to the direction of the
project (and potentially save yourself some time!).

## Getting Started
To start working on the codebase, first fork the repo, then clone it:
```
git clone git@github.com:your-username/js-buy-sdk.git
```
*Note: replace "your-username" with your Github handle*

Install the project's dependencies:
```
npm install
```

Run the server:
```
npm start
```
Add some tests and make your change. Re-run the tests with:
```
npm run test
```

## Documentation
If your change affects how people use the project (i.e. adding or
changing arguments to a function, adding a new function, changing the
return value, etc), please ensure the documentation is also updated to
reflect this. The docs server can be run with `npm run doc-server` and
runs at `http://localhost:5000`.

## Code of Conduct
As contributors and maintainers of this project, and in the interest of
fostering an open and welcoming community, we pledge to respect all
people who contribute through reporting issues, posting feature
requests, updating documentation, submitting pull requests or patches,
and other activities.

We are committed to making participation in this project a
harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of level of
experience, gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation,
disability, personal appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, age,
religion, or nationality.

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery
* Personal attacks
* Trolling or insulting/derogatory comments
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing other's private information, such as physical or electronic
addresses, without explicit permission
* Other unethical or unprofessional conduct

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit,
or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other
contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban
temporarily or permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they
deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

By adopting this Code of Conduct, project maintainers commit themselves
to fairly and consistently applying these principles to every aspect of
managing this project. Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce
the Code of Conduct may be permanently removed from the project team.

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public
spaces when an individual is representing the project or its community.

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may
be reported by contacting a project maintainer at [INSERT EMAIL
ADDRESS]. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will
result in a response that is deemed necessary and appropriate to the
circumstances. Maintainers are obligated to maintain confidentiality
with regard to the reporter of an incident.
